Object Recognition in video using TensorFlow &amp; OpenCv

This tutorial will focus on how you can detect various objects in a video stream, either live or pre-recorded, using the TensorFlow Object Detection Library.
In order to recognise vaious objects in a video, we will make use of pre-trainned models available in the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md">TensorFlow Model Zoo</a>

In-order to succssefully run this tutorial, you need to have the following in place:

1. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
2. TensorFlow
3. OpenCv
4. Python3.x

These requirements constitute the prefered environment to run the tutorial. You can be able to run the tutorial using any other versions of the software, different from what is outlined.

The goal of this tutorial is to show you how you can use the TensorFlow framework in a real life situation. Hopefully you will be able to grasp one or two concepts then you build from there.

Let us begin

After installing your linux environment (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)
